<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
<h2>Basement Flood Alert System — January 2023 - Present</h2>

<p>Built a Flood Alarm System using Raspberry Pi that goes off as an
alert signal generator as part of a Design Thinking Project. The purpose was
to prevent loss of property during floods for residents in low lying areas, by
alerting them when water levels started to rise beyond a fixed level.</p>

<h2>Smart Electricity Energy Meter— August 2021 - December 2021</h2>

<p>Built a WiFi-enabled Smart Electricity Energy Meter using Arduino.
One of the key problems of the existing energy meter system is that there is
no full duplex communication. To solve this problem, we used a working example
based on the Internet of Things (loT) to build this smart energy meter. Energy
analysis by the consumer becomes much easier and controllable.</p>
